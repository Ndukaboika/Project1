Suicide-related behaviors have also been linked with viewing of associated web content. Studies on traditional bullying indicate that the roles of bullying involvement (bullies, victims, and bully-victims) matter in terms of associations with specific suicide-related behaviors and psychological problems. Yet, related research in the area of cyberbullying is lacking. The current study investigates the association of cyberbullying roles with viewing of specific suicide-related web content and psychological problems. Data from N = 19,406 (50 percent girls) 1116-year-olds (M = 13.54, SD = 1.68) of a representative sample of Internet-using children in Europe were analyzed. Self-reports were obtained for cyberbullying role, viewing of web content related to self-harm, and suicide, as well as the emotional, peer, and conduct problem subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that compared with those not involved in cyberbullying, viewing of web content related to suicide was higher for cybervictims and cyberbully-victims, but not for cyberbullies. Viewing of web content related to self-harm was higher for all cyberbullying roles, especially for cyberbully-victims. Rates of emotional problems were higher among cybervictims and cyberbully-victims, rates of peer problems were higher for cybervictims, and rates of conduct problems were higher for all cyberbullying roles. Moreover, the links between cyberbullying role and viewing of suicide-related web content were independent of psychological problems. The results can be useful to more precisely target efforts toward the specific problems of each cyberbullying role. The outcomes on viewing of web content also indicate an opportunity to enhance the presence of health service providers on Internet platforms.

Current literature neglects to address common themes, range of symptomatology, or trends and patterns imbedded in this phenomenon. There are comprehensive definitions of bullying that exist in the psychological literature (Espelage & Swearer, 2003; Matthiesen and Einarsen, 2004; Tehrani, 2004); however, the ways in which the implications of these definitions and subsequent symptomatology manifest in individuals as adults who have survived bullying and related forms of developmental trauma in their early years is as of yet inconclusive. Studies investigating the impact of adverse childhood events found that survivors 'had generally worse long-term adverse effects on young adults' mental health' (Lereya, Copeland, Costello, & Walke, 2015) and 'are more likely to experience chronic psychological and health problems such as depression, anxiety, aggression, sleep disturbance, severe obesity, somatic complaints and substance abuse' (Martin et al., 2010, p. 110--111). Psychological implications documented in the literature include but are not limited to anxiety, poor academic performance, emotional traumatization, posttraumatic stress, and even suicide (Dupper & Meyer-Adams, 2002; Espelage & Swearer, 2003; Glover, Gough, Johnson & Cartwright, 2000; Knack, Gomez & Jensen-Campbell, 2011; Tehrani, 2004; Ttofi & Farrington, 2008). Despite the growing body of literature on children and bullying, the prevalence rates of bullying continue to increase with alarming speed, signifying the critical need for more research. Symptoms consistent with anxiety spectrum and mood disorders have been observed among individuals who have experienced childhood bullying as well as other domains of psychological diagnoses (Ivarsson et al., 2005; Ttofi & Farrington, 2008). Due to these discoveries, bullying trauma in childhood as a predictor for mental health issues and disturbances in functioning have been investigated as a potential trigger for possible psychological and emotional impairment. This study aimed to demystify the cognitive and psychological outcomes for adults who have survived bullying in childhood and uncover the latent effect of childhood bullying using qualitative measures to most appropriately address and capture the range and intricacy of each individual's experience.

However, indirect forms of socialization were found. After controlling for direct socialization and selection effects, friends' depressive symptoms predicted changes in male and female adolescents' NSSI, and friends' impulsivity predicted changes in male adolescents' NSSI.

Methods: We conducted latent class analysis using the national 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey data for the overall sample, and separately by sex (N = 13,583). Results: Over half of the sample (53%) belonged to the low risk subgroup (Class 1). Class 2 accounted for 15% of adolescents, and over 40% in this subgroup reported riding with a drunk driver, and 63% reported texting while driving a vehicle. Over 14% belonged to Class 3, which had a higher probability of being depressed and suicidal (81% and 64%, respectively). Class 4 accounted for over 9% of adolescents who reported high probabilities for current cigarette (97%), tobacco (99%), and alcohol use (73%); and over half reported current marijuana use (52%).

Conclusion: Several adolescent risk behaviors are interrelated regardless of sex. However, sex differences in the higher probability of depressive symptoms and suicidality among girls highlight the need for interventions that consider the demographic composition of adolescents.","Senior Research Scientist, Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, Research and Evaluation, McLean and Assistant Professor, West Virginia University School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics and Chair and Professor, West Virginia University School of Public Health, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Research Assistant Professor, West Virginia University School of Public Health, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Professor, West Virginia University School of Public Health, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences",NA,"10.5993/AJHB.43.3.1","Oak Ridge, North Carolina","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,uid&db=rzh&AN=136145971&site=ehost-live&scope=site","American Journal of Health Behavior",NA,"rzh",NA,"EBSCOhost","136145971","Accession Number: 136145971.

Methods: The analysis included 30,284 school children aged 1315 years from seven ASEAN countries that participated in the cross-sectional global school-based student health survey (GSHS) between 2007 and 2013. Results: The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months across seven ASEAN countries was 12.3%, significantly higher in girls (15.1%) than boys (9.3%). Among seven ASEAN countries with the highest prevalence of suicidal ideation was in the Philippines (17.0%) and Vietnam (16.9%) and the lowest in Myanmar (1.1%) and Indonesia (4.2%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, female gender, older age (14 or 15 years), living in a lower middle income country, having no friends, loneliness, bullying victimisation, having been in a physical fight in the past 12 months, lack of parental or guardian support, tobacco use and having a history of ever got drunk were associated with suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Different rates of suicidal ideation were observed in ASEAN member states. Several risk factors for suicidal ideation were identified which can help guide preventive efforts.

We suggest that the emergence of cyber-bullying and media coverage that linked this form of bullying with the suicide of individual youths fostered renewed social concern in the topic, which has in turn spearheaded novel legal responses. These processes have occurred, however, when research on cyber-bullying remains in its early stages and thus in response to aspects of the digital revolution that remain poorly understood. We aim to critically evaluate extant empirical data about the relationship between bullying and an increased risk for suicidal behavior. We will review various legislative responses to bullying that have largely resulted from how the digital revolution configures the phenomenon of bullying. In this discussion we will consider the congruence between developmental research on bullying and emerging legal interventions.

This article reviews the extant literature on the associations between bullying perpetration, victimization, and thoughts of or attempts at suicide and proposes five potential mediators, namely depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, loneliness, and hopelessness, that may explain this relationship. Numerous studies have found empirical support for the interrelations between internalizing behaviors and both bullying perpetration and victimization and suicide. We find that further longitudinal research needs to be conducted to more conclusively determine the role and causal ordering these various psychosocial factors may play in bullying perpetration, victimization, and suicide. Although the research literature implies causal directions among all these potential mediators, untangling the unique influence of bullying perpetration, victimization, and bully victimization on suicide and its mechanisms of action has major research and practice implications.

We conducted a series of meta-analyses to assess whether LAI-APs affect the mortality of patients with schizophrenia. Three categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to compare all-cause death (primary outcome) and death due to suicide: individual and pooled LAI-APs vs placebo, individual and pooled LAI-APs vs oral antipsychotics (OAPs), and head-to-head comparisons of LAI-APs. The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated. We identified 52 RCTs (53 comparisons; total participants = 17 416, LAI-APs = 11 360, OAP = 3910, and placebo = 2146; mean study duration [wk]: LAI-APs vs placebo = 28.9, LAI-APs vs OAPs = 64.5). Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone) differed from the placebo regarding the incidences of all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.64, P = .37) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.98, P = .98). However, in a subgroup meta-analysis of only short-duration RCTs (13 wk), pooled LAI-APs exhibited a trend toward lower incidence of all-cause death than placebo (RR = 0.29, P = .08). Pooled LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol) did not differ from pooled OAPs regarding all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.71, P = .30) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.94, P = .91). Individual LAI-APs and OAPs were associated with similar risks of death. Data for head-to-head comparisons of individual LAI-APs were insufficient. In conclusion, there was no significant difference between LAI-APs and placebo or OAPs regarding all-cause death and death due to suicide.

She also met criteria for the melancholic features specifier, as she had loss of pleasure in almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli. After being admitted to the inpatient unit, a biopsychosocial approach to her management was instituted which included antidepressant therapy, group and individual psychotherapy, and parental discussions to eliminate ongoing cyber bullying. The patient improved and remains stable, and every effort was made to directly ascertain the possibility of bullying and follow through to ensure it is terminated.

A monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A showed a positive effect in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, and a humanised form of this antibody (ozanezumab) was well tolerated in a first-in-human trial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanezumab in patients with ALS. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done in 34 centres in 11 countries. Patients aged 1880 years with a diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally according to a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive ozanezumab (15 mg/kg) or placebo as intravenous infusions over 1 h every 2 weeks for 46 weeks, followed by assessments at week 48 and week 60. Patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was a joint-rank analysis of function (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) and overall survival, analysed at 48 weeks in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01753076, and with GSK-ClinicalStudyRegister.com, NOG112264, and is completed. Findings: Between Dec 20, 2012, and Nov 1, 2013, we recruited 307 patients, of whom 303 were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 151) or ozanezumab (n = 152). The adjusted mean of the joint-rank score was 149 (SE 135) for the ozanezumab group and 150 (136) for the placebo group, with a least squares mean difference of 300 (95% CI 679 to 79; p = 012). Overall, reported adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study were similar between the treatment groups, except for dyspepsia (ten [7%] in the ozanezumab group vs four [3%] in the placebo group), depression (11 [7%] vs five [3%]), and diarrhoea (25 [16%] vs 12 [8%]). Respiratory failure was the most common serious adverse event (12 [8%] vs seven [5%]). At week 60, the number of deaths was higher in the ozanezumab group (20 [13%]) than in the placebo group (16 [11%]), mainly as a result of respiratory failure (ten [7%] vs five [3%]). Two deaths were considered related to the study drug (bladder transitional cell carcinoma in the ozanezumab group and cerebrovascular accident in the placebo group). Interpretation: Ozanezumab did not show efficacy compared with placebo in patients with ALS. Therefore, Nogo-A does not seem to be an effective therapeutic target in ALS.

However, nearly all existing literature has relied on cross-sectional data. Using data from the first 2 panels of a multisite longitudinal study on risk and protective factors for suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youth in 3 U.S. cities, we examined the influence of presence of and participation in a GSA on perceptions of safety at school, homophobic bullying experiences, and psychosocial adjustment (depression and self-esteem) in 327 LGBQ students across 2 school years. LGBQ students who had GSAs in their schools or were members of GSAs in the prior year showed no differences in psychological adjustment, but they reported perceptions of more school safety and less homophobic bullying in the following school year. Further, changes in GSA presence (gaining a GSA) and changes in participation (from nonparticipation to participation) were independently associated with stronger perceived safety in the subsequent school year. This study provides the first prospective evidence of the lasting positive role of GSAs for high school students, and documents that changes in GSA presence and participation are associated with safety at school.

In some cases, students have been cyberbullied so brutally that adolescent victims even contemplate or commit suicide. The central focus of this research study was to describe how school leaders are effectively managing and reducing the number of cyberbullying incidents. The researcher implemented a qualitative multiple case study design and interviewed teachers, parents, and administrators at three independent middle schools in southern California. Findings revealed that school leaders take immediate action to resolve incidents, but that their ability to consistently monitor student online communication is exceedingly difficult. Since victims can experience continued repercussions even after an incident has been addressed, more follow-through with victims and perpetrators is needed as well as uncovering the root cause of incidents to more effectively resolve situations. Furthermore, school intervention that is well intentioned can sometimes perpetuate or act as a catalyst for repercussions on the victims, and parent responses and involvement can sometimes impede successful management by school leaders.

Most schools have been implementing anti-bullying prevention and intervention programs. Nevertheless, the issue of bullying and suicide persists. A meta-analysis found that school-based anti-bullying programs resulted, in a positive and statistically significant effect in reducing bullying, but the overall effect size was small and did not meet the threshold for practical significance. Another meta-analysis found that school-based anti-bullying programs resulted in changes in students' attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of bullying, but not in their behaviors. When considering suicide prevention, most studies could not identify a critical ingredient in their school-based programs that leads to successful outcomes. One study found that children's reports of suicidal behaviors and depression tended to decrease, but their helping and coping strategies did not improve. Although students' levels of suicide attempts went down after participating in a school based psycho-educational program, their reports of suicidal ideation remained stable. One of the possible explanations for the ineffectiveness of many anti-bullying programs in North America is the failure to intervene at the environmental level. Similarly, in terms of suicide prevention programs, there is lack of evidence that purely educational approaches can effectively lead depressed and suicidal youth to seek professional help. Drawing from studies focusing on peer social ecologies and youth outcomes, this chapter considers elements of classroom environments that promote healthy peer relationships, which may eventually help reduce bullying and suicidal behaviors. We begin with theories of suicide to uncover specific aspects of bullying that may trigger self-destructive behaviors among youth. We then turn to empirical studies that focus on the association between bullying and suicide, and the effect of classroom structures and teaching practices on bullying and rejection. We provide directions for future research to promote healthier classroom environments for youth. We conclude the chapter with the suggestion that improving youths' feelings of belonging can be among the ways adults can reduce bullying and suicidal behaviors among children and adolescents.
