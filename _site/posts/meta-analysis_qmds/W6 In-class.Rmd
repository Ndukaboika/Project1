# Ready

If you haven't installed the following packages, run the codes below:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("metafor")
```

Load the packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(metafor)
```

# `metafor` R package

The `metafor` package includes the \href{https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/escalc.html}{`escalc` function} for computing a wide range of ES estimates. See its online document for details.

-   NOTE: \texttt{escalc} uses a slightly different approximation for the sampling variance of $g$. You can change the variance estimator using the \texttt{vtype} argument.

# Ch 7. Exercise 1

```{r}
# Read data 

ex1dat <- read.csv("Ex1_dat.csv")
```

## Hand calculation:

```{r}

```

## Use `escalc`:

$SMD = \frac{m1i - m2i}{s_p}$, we define `m1i` = Treatment group's mean, `m2i` = Control group's mean.

```{r}
escalc(measure = "SMD", 
       m1i = mean(ex1dat$Treatment), sd1i = sd(ex1dat$Treatment), n1i = 8,
       m2i = mean(ex1dat$Control), sd2i = sd(ex1dat$Control), n2i = 8, 
       var.names = c("g", "v_g"))

```


```{r}
escalc(measure = "SMD", 
       m1i = 17.64, sd1i = 11.57, n1i = 147,
       m2i = 19.25, sd2i = 10.56, n2i = 109, 
       var.names = c("g", "v_g"))
```

# Ch 7. Exercise 3

```{r}
ex3dat <- read.csv("deltas.csv")
```

## Hand caluclation

```{r}

```

## Use metafor

```{r}
week6_correct <- escalc(measure = "SMD", 
       data = ex3dat,
       m1i = MTx, sd1i = SDTx, n1i = nTx,
       m2i = MCtl, sd2i = SDCtl, n2i = nCtl, 
       var.names = c("g", "v_g"))

week6_correct

write.csv(week6_correct, file = "inclass_wk62.csv", fileEncoding = "macroman")
```
